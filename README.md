## My process

I first started working on the html part where I added divs and assigned classes in order to make my css process easier. I decided to split the main container into 2 smaller containers, the left-container that contains all the text and the right-container with the image. After that I worked at each container trying to replicate the design as accurate as I could.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

The things I learned in this project:
-how to apply a colour overlay for a photo;
-using vw for a text size in order to resize it with the window width
